# dali-app-23w

## Overview
For my developer supplement, I made a landing page that offers you the current weather and time, and also allows you to play music randomly selected with a certin genre. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data, and the iTunes API to fetch music data. Additionally, I added google authentification functionality so that the page could be more customizable. 

## How to Run
Open up the dali_app folder in terminal and run `npm start`. 

## Going Forward
I'd like to include more customization functionality, such as choosing a theme, adding more widgets, and selecting your own genres.
